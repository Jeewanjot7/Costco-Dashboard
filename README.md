# Costco Wholesale Corporation Supply Chain Dashboard


## Introduction

Costco Wholesale Corporation is a leading global retailer that aims to enhance its operational efficiency and customer satisfaction while maintaining low prices and high member retention. 

Information on Open-Source Data

For this project, we got data from Kaggle, a well-known platform where data can be shared, and we can explore real-world datasets for project usage. So, we used Costco Wholesale Corporation data which include the following information: 
* Product Categories: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies
•	Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Shipping Date, Shipping Mode
•	Customer Details: Customer ID, Customer Name
•	Sales Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discounts, and Profit


## Purpose 

1.	Analyze sales performance across product categories and identify trends over time.
2.	Evaluate shipping methods and their impact on delivery efficiency and costs.
3.	Categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and preferences.
4.	Measure and analyze profitability across product lines and customer segments.

## Goal

1.	Assess total sales figures to gauge overall revenue.
2.	Identify opportunities to optimize shipping processes for cost savings and faster delivery times.
3.	Identify high-value customer segments that significantly contribute to revenue.
4.	Calculate profit margins to evaluate the financial health of various products.

## Key Questions

1.	How have sales figures across different product categories changed over the last year, and what seasonal or market trends can be identified that may influence future sales strategies?
2.	Which shipping methods have demonstrated the highest efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and how do these methods affect overall customer satisfaction and repeat business?

These questions will help guide your analysis and provide actionable insights.

## Metrics and KPI’s

•	Average Order Value (AOV): Calculated by dividing total sales by 
                  the number of orders to understand customer spending behavior.
